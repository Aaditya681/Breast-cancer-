In this walkthrough report I am going to discuss the statical methods that were used in the dataset. The dataset that is used 
in this report is about Breast cancer. This dataset of breast cancer was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER 
program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients 
with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed 
in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival 
months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included(Kaggle.com).

The dataset here is anyalyzed using analysis like univariate analysis ,bivariate analysis, distribution analysis, mean 
median,standard analayis etc.We are using collab research by google to show the statical analysis. All the data are showed in 
numbers and in a bar graph.

Introduction
Lets understand about the statical analysis on a large number of dataset. We are doing analysis on a large number of random 
samples. According to the law of large numbers, the mean of a population gets closer to its average proportional to the 
number of samples. But what makes this law of large number of important is the fact that after doing a random experiment a 
large number of times, the outcome of the experiment becomes stable.
Using statistical inferences, we can infer conclusions based on a sample taken from the population.There are many
concepts and terms that we need to be aware of like population,sample,parameter and statistic. 
Lets talk about univariate analysis, Univariate summarize only one variable at a time.For examples:when you want to find 
the average household electrical bill value or you might want to study about a group od diabetic patients to find their 
weights and so on.

Here is a bar graph of an univariate analysis on the dataset based on the findings.It shows the ratio of white and 
black cloured skin based on their race.
Similarly, we have Bivariate 
analysis.The primary purpose of 
bivariate data is to compare the 
two sets of data to find a 
relationship between the two 
variables. If one variable 
influences the change in another 
variable ,then you have an 
independent and dependent 
variable.
In the figure there is a bar graph 
that shows Married women 
either white or black race has 
highest rate of breast cancer than 
other 
We can also calculate mean,median and standard deviation from the dataset
